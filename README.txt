"malfunction", a first 3D game made using "Castle Game Engine" and VRML models.
Done a long time ago (before 2004).
WWW page is on http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/malfunction.php .

*Do not* use the sources of this game as an example how to use
"Castle Game Engine". We employ here a lot of old, deprecated
and uncomfortable ways to deal with 3D stuff.
