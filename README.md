# malfunction

A first 3D game made using "Castle Game Engine" and Blender and VRML models. Done a long time ago (before 2004). Please *do not* use the sources of this game as an example how to use "Castle Game Engine" --- we use here a lot of old, deprecated and uncomfortable ways to deal with 3D stuff!
